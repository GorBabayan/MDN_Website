                Yerevan, capital of Armenia. It is situated on the Hrazdan River, 14 miles (23 km) from the Turkish frontier. Though first historically recorded in 607 ce, Yerevan dates by archaeological evidence to a settlement on the site in the 6th–3rd millennia bce and subsequently to the fortress of Erebuni in 783 bce. From the 6th century bce it formed part of the Armenian kingdom.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The city developed as an important focus of trade and has had a long history of siege and storm. At different times it came under the Romans (a ruined fortress remains), Parthians, Arabs, Mongols, Turks, Persians, Georgians, and Russians. In 1582 it fell to the Turks, in 1604 to the Persians, and finally in 1827 to the Russians. In 1920 Yerevan became the capital of the independent Armenian republic. It remained the capital during the periods of Soviet rule and of renewed independence.

                Modern Yerevan, which climbs the hillsides from the deep trench of the Hrazdan, is an attractive city in a fine natural setting framed by the extinct volcanic peaks of Mount Aragats and Mount Azhdaak to the north and Mount Ararat across the Turkish frontier to the south. Many modern buildings along its tree-lined streets have been constructed in traditional Armenian styles and of variously coloured local stone. Yerevan is a major cultural centre, with a university founded in 1919 and many other institutions of higher education. The Armenian Academy of Sciences (established 1943) is the most prominent of the many research institutions in the city. The Matenadaran archives (founded 1920) hold a rich collection of ancient Armenian manuscripts, such as the Lazarus Gospel of 887. Yerevan also has many theatres and museums.

            <h3>Bagratid Armenia</h3>
            <p>
                After two centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the Bagratid prince Ashot I of Armenia led the revolution against the Abbasid Caliphate. Ashot I liberated Yerevan in 850, and was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'in in 862. Ashot was later crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885. During the rule of the Bagratuni dynasty of Armenia between 885 and 1045, Yerevan was relatively a secure part of the Kingdom before falling to the Byzantines.
However, Yerevan did not have any strategic role during the reign of the Bagratids, who developed many other cities of Ayrarat, such as Shirakavan, Dvin, and Ani.
